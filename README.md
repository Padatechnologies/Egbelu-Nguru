How it works

i. Tuition is paid directly to the university after securing an admission. If visa or study permit is denied and the student does not want to continue with the program or university, the University refunds the student. However, some administrative fee may apply depending on the University.

ii. Air ticket: payable after visa/study permit and/travel is confirmed. Tickets are insured and valid for one year and may be refundable under certain conditions.

iii. Accommodation: after securing admission and confirming visa status, any student who desires this service is connected to a confirmed partner property agent/property owner for virtual viewing and meeting with the property owner. If the student is satisfied with the property, a tenancy agreement form is signed, and deposit paid directly to property owner.

iv. Airport service, this is a reserved service that is only payable at the airport to the service provider. For instance, airport taxi is reserved for the student after travel confirmation. Once the student arrives at the airport, payment is made to the driver. There is also upfront payment which is cheaper than payment on arrival.

v. Social-matching - paid directly to the service provider after arriving the destination and service is used. Us takes time to confirm the service providers.
